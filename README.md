## Data Science with Sunrise Bay Area Movement

<!-- 1. [Mission](#mission)

### Mission
What guarantees the success of a movement? According to [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world), movements with an active base of **at least 3.5%** of the population have never failed. The Sunrise Movement strategically uses this to gauge our progress in halting fossil fuel politics and achieving a greener, livable future with the [Green New Deal.](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/green-new-deal)

In order for our hub to achieve this threshold, we only need 3.5% of the population of the Bay Area: <br>
`about 7.75 million * 3.5% = 271,250 supporters`

<!-- Using our membership data, we can build our supporter base. -->

### Goals
Our mission is to use data to improve overall hub engagement through:
* **Identifying Supporters:** locating our members vs supporters as well as active vs passive supporters in order to quantify our success threshold for active advocates
* **Demographic Analysis:** understanding our membership representation in race, gender, income, etc. to improve event planning and better serve our frontline communities
* **Communications:** improving click rate for emails as well as our event attendance  




<!-- * Understanding membership demographics
* Identifying active vs passive supports, members vs supporters (status, date joined, etc.)
* Create target communications and improve event planning to better support members
* Improving open/click rate for emails
* Increasing attendance for events -->
